# Covid-19-convolutional-neural-network
Covid-19 detection using x-ray and deep convulutional neural networks. 

This project uses the covid-19 x-ray dataset https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset to create different models of convolutional neural networks. 

The steps to create and validate the models were the following:

1. Preprocess the dataset images so they fit better to most of convolutional neural network models.
2. Fit and validate several models such as VGG16, VGG19, Weighted VGG19...
3. Use explainability techniques to find which features explain the covid-19 on the x-ray images.

The models score an accuracy higher than 90%.
